# SRMEats
As forever hungry hostellers (and Day Scholars) we have so much of food variety right here in the campus and still each time we step out, we discover a new place to eat and hang out! It becomes difficult to pick a favorite. But SRMEats is here to help. It combines suggestions and reviews of students like you and me, puts together an algorithm that will become your favorite!!
Difficult to comprehend? Let us simplify it!

We hand collected a list of eateries in and around SRM. (We have your favourite place also, don't forget!)
We then made a form, (you might be one of the form fillers) forwarded them and created a database that collects the favorite food places of the students individually. 
Through tedious amounts of work, we created an outline of the places, it's specialities and much more.
After that, we deployed it on the website combined with other interesting facts and stories about food, for you to explore new places and cuisines, or just go to your favorites and enjoy. 

We sincerely tried to create something 
BY THE STUDENTS, FOR THE STUDENTS,  OF THE STUDENTS. 

Next time you want to look for a a new place or a good suggestion, we are the best choice. 
We aim to provide places that are near to you, affordable and suggested by your friends. 

Sounds cool, right?

Welcome to SRMEats!
Explore the flavors!
